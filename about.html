            <p class="small-padding-bottom">
                Born in the mid-80s in Madrid, Spain, I received my basic and highschool education in Madrid's Lycée Français where I obtained my "scientific" Baccalauréat.<br/>
                Starting on my teen ages I developed a growing interest on technology and soon I started to mess around with PCs. At the age of 15 I was loving Linux and C, even though 
                there was still a lot to understand; and soon enough I programmed my first driver for a simple display, setting the foundations for my ever lasting love for electronics and DIY.
                From there, a whole new world opened before me with smartphones on my student years and this is what led me to choose a main career on Android development.

            <p class="small-padding-bottom">
                Aside from my technology facette, I've always had a love for a variety of things: languages, cars, quirky travel, photography...
                I had the chance to learn French, English and German in school and later on studied a fair amount of Japanese. Those skills came years after with the will to spend
                time living abroad and this is why I lived for a while in Berlin, then Prague and finally Tokyo returning in 2013 to Madrid.<br/>
                In Madrid I explored different forms of travel, ranging from crossing Europe hitchiking to driving from Madrid to Vladivostok in a 25 years old van (<a href="https://www.instagram.com/novolamos">check it out!</a>)
                or driving a 50cc moped from Madrid to Berlin.<br/>
                In more recent years I've turned very much into DIY, old cars and mechanics and camper vans; I've build a camper from scratch on VW and owned some 30 years-old cars which I love to ride and repair.<br/>

            <p class="small-padding-bottom">
                On and off I've developed a liking and (hopefully) a good eye for photography, the results of which can be checked on my <a href="https://flickr.com/photos/cdiazc">Flickr</a> profile.<br/>
                Besides from all that I like to make scenaries for model trains, build (some of) my own furtinure, type on a Model M IBM keyboard and obviously, I love LEGO !
